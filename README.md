Absolutely! Here's a clean and clear `README.md` file you can add to your project to explain:

* What this AR project is about
* How to run it
* Group member contributions
* How to test and use it

# AR Project – Marker-Based Augmented Reality Park Scene

This is a group project developed using **A-Frame** and **AR.js** for the subject **CTSE - Modern Topics in Software Engineering**. The goal was to create a **marker-based AR web application** that displays 3D objects related to a selected scene — in this case, a **Park** — and enhances the experience with sound, animation, and interactivity.

---

## 🏞️ Theme: Park

Each group member contributed one 3D object that would typically be found in a park.

| Member | Model           | Marker Used                    | Creative Feature              |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Member 1 | Tree + Bench     | `pattern-tree.patt`             | Rotation animation + birds sound |
| Member 2 | Park Bench       | `pattern-bench.patt`            | Rotation + ambient crowd sound |
| Member 3 | Tent             | `pattern-tent.patt`             | Bouncing animation + tent flap sound |
| Member 4 | Picnic Basket    | `pattern-shopping-basket.patt` | Scaling animation + picnic ambience |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/)
- [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/)
- Local Web Server (`local-web-server` via Node.js)

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

> 🔐 **HTTPS is required** for AR.js to access your camera.

### Step 1: Install Local Web Server (One-time only)
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
npm install -g local-web-server
````

### Step 2: Start the server

In your project folder (`ar-project`):

```bash
ws --https
```

### Step 3: Open the app in your browser

* Use the HTTPS link provided by `ws` (e.g., `https://192.168.x.x:8000`)
* Open the link on a **mobile device** or **laptop with webcam**
* **Allow camera permissions**

---

## 🎯 How to Test

1. **Print or display** each marker file (`.patt`) as a black-and-white visual square (from the generator).
2. Open the app and scan one marker at a time.
3. Watch the corresponding 3D model appear, animate, and play sound!

## 📹 Demo

> A short video (under 5 minutes) has been recorded showing marker detection and each object in action.
